  <h1>Richard Lee</h1>
  <p>I was Active Duty Army for eight years and have been in the Army Reserves for the past three years. In the Army, I started off as a Helicopter Mechanic and ended up as a Production Contorl Supervisor. On my last deployment, which ended February 2020, I no longer wanted to leave my family to go to a war zone, so I am now learning new skills to start a new career as a Software Engineer.</p>
  <p>I have about 90 credits from Washington State University and Seattle Pacific University.</p>
  <p>My long term goal is to obtain a career at a large company that will pay well and let me work remotely. I want to work remotely, so I can travel to any place I want and still be able to work.</p>
